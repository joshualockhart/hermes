LiDE "Linux Disk Extractor"

As of version 0.0.1.1 it has the same functionality as running a string of commands:
-dd to capture a file (more like cat though)
-pv "pipe viewer" to view the progress of the file transfer
-netcat to send the file over the network
All packaged into a small executable less than 15Kb in size.

The following command could accomplish the same results:
cat File_to_Transfer | pv | nc -l -p 31337
